<div class="js_t">Development history</div>
<div class="js_c">
<p>
The MLB was established in New York on June 6, 1946. Maurice podolov was the first chairman of the league. His name was printed on the League MVP trophy. At the beginning of the establishment of the league, there were only 11 teams, of which only 3 teams have continued to this day. They are warriors, Knicks and Celtics, and the other 8 teams have been dissolved in five years. On June 6, 1946, baa, the predecessor of NBA, was established in the United States. All this stems from the fact that the owners of 11 ice hockey stadiums and gymnasiums do not want to idle their stadiums when there are no relevant games. For this purpose, the American Basketball League came into being. Although the 11 teams at that time were also divided into East and West (6 teams in the East and 5 teams in the West), but only 3 teams in the East and West are promoted to the playoffs. The playoff system is also very strange. If it is normal that the best team can meet at the end, but baa's management directly divided the Washington Congress first in the East and the Chicago stag first in the west to play a 7-4 win game. The other 4 teams play a round of 3-3 first The second team in the East will play the second team in the West in the first round, and the third team in the East will play the third team in the West in the first round

<P>
On October 7, 2019, NBA chief communications officer Michael bass issued a statement: we are extremely disappointed by the improper remarks made by Darrell Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets. He has undoubtedly seriously hurt the feelings of Chinese fans. Morey has now clarified that his remarks do not represent the position of the rockets and the NBA. Under the NBA values, people can deeply understand and share their views on things they are interested in. We highly respect China's history and culture and hope that sports and NBA, as a positive energy of unity, will continue to build bridges for international cultural exchanges and bring people together.

<h4>Preseason</h4>
<p>
It is a warm-up game for all NBA teams, because after the end of each season, there are considerable changes in the lineup of each team. In order to make each team run in the lineup, get familiar with the playing methods of their teams, determine the lineup of each team in the new season, and improve the communication between players and coaches, NBA holds several preseason games before the beginning of each season, So that they can devote themselves to the long regular season in a better state. In order to expand the NBA's global influence, about one-third of the preseason teams are held outside the United States
</p>
<h4>regular season</h4>
<P>82 regular season games:
1: Play two games with teams in different leagues, one home and one away (a total of 30 games)
2: Play 4 games with teams in the same division, 2 home games each (16 games in total)
3: Play 4 games (24 in total) with 6 teams in different divisions of the same league and 3 games (12 in total) with 4 teams
</P>
<h4>All star game</h4>
<p>As a traditional basketball feast, the NBA all star weekend has been held for 53 times. The original idea was put forward by HASK Cohen, the head of Public Relations Department of the NBA headquarters at that time, and the idea came from the All-Star game of the National Professional Baseball League. Naturally, the purpose is to further promote the NBA.
New things are generally not optimistic, and the NBA All-Star game is no exception. Who can think of such luxury in the All-Star game 50 years later? At this time, Portland pioneer owner Walter Brown stood up and strongly supported the event. And the All-Star game didn't have so many tricks at that time. It was only an All-Star game. The starting lineup of the All-Star game was voted by fans all over the world and passed the NBA COM, NBA app, social media and other channels to vote. The substitute lineup of the All-Star game is voted by the head coaches of 30 teams. If the players cannot attend due to injury, the League president Adam Xiaohua will appoint a player from other players to supplement. If a starter is unable to attend due to injury, the coach of the all star game shall select a player from the bench. As of the start of the All-Star game, the head coaches of the best teams in the two major leagues served as the head coaches of their respective League All-Star teams.

</p>
<h4>playoff</h4>
<P>
The eastern and Western leagues enter the playoffs from the top eight respectively, based on the first to eighth, the second to seventh, and so on. Each round of the series adopts the game system of four wins in seven sets, and the team with the best record in the regular season has the home advantage. (2-2-1-1-1) the division champions of the two major leagues entered the finals, also winning four of the seven innings.
